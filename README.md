# Datasets and other custom template for Jupyter notebook
These are data sets for different supervised learning projects. The car_flower folder contain images of cars and flowers used for classification. I used this set for transfer learning in my deep neural networks with keras contents. 
The myclassic folder contains templates for customizing Jupyter notebook and for exporting Jupyter notebook with the style, theme and css preserved as shown in the screenshot below. I customized the css and also the conf.json files and replaced the default template.
